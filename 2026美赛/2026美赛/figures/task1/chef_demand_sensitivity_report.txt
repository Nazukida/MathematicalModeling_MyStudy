2. Key Insights
----------------------------------------
   - The most critical driver is A: AI Enhance. (-> F_t).
     A 10% change in this parameter causes a 0.8% swing in final employment.
   - AI Enhancement (A) plays a significant role, confirming that the productivity boost factor is crucial for this model.
   - Automation Potential (D1) has a negative impact. This means as AI gets more capable, jobs in this field SHRINK.
