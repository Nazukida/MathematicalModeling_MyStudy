1. Analysis of Automation Potential (D1)
----------------------------------------
   - Parameter Range: D1 varies from 0.50 to 0.70
   - Effect on Saturation: As D1 increases, the maximum AI penetration rate increases.
   - Sensitivity: A change of 0.20 in D1 results in a 19.55% difference in peak penetration.
   - Interpretation: Occupations with higher automation potential will see AI completely taking over tasks much earlier and to a greater extent.

2. Analysis of Skill Evolution Speed (D2)
----------------------------------------
   - Parameter Range: D2 varies from 0.30 to 0.50
   - Effect on Speed: High D2 accelerates the S-curve, causing the 'steep' adoption phase to occur sooner.
   - Sensitivity: At the mid-point (2029), increasing D2 changes penetration from 50.7% to 55.4%.
   - Interpretation: For fields where technology evolves rapidly (High D2), the window for adaptation is much smaller.
